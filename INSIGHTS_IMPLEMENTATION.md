# Financial Analytics & Insights Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Financial Analytics MCP (Model Context Protocol) for intelligent financial analysis and insights generation.

## Architecture

### Core Service: `FinancialAnalyticsService`

Location: `/Code/Core/Analytics/FinancialAnalyticsService.swift`

The service provides four main capabilities:

#### 1. Automatic Transaction Categorization
```swift
func categorizeTransactions(_ transactions: [Transaction]) -> [Transaction]
```

**Features:**
- Keyword-based pattern matching
- Supports Brazilian service names (iFood, Uber, Rappi, etc.)
- Categories: Food, Transportation, Shopping, Entertainment, Health, Bills
- Only categorizes transactions marked as "Other"

**Example Keywords:**
- Food: "restaurante", "ifood", "mercado", "supermercado"
- Transportation: "uber", "99", "posto", "gasolina"
- Bills: "energia", "Ã¡gua", "internet", "celular", "aluguel"

#### 2. Spending Pattern Detection
```swift
func detectSpendingPatterns(transactions: [Transaction], budgets: [Budget]) -> [SpendingPattern]
```

**Analyzes:**
- Total spent per category
- Average transaction amount
- Transaction frequency
- Spending trends (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Budget comparison status (healthy/warning/critical/exceeded)

**Trend Detection:**
- Compares first half vs second half of period
- >20% increase = Increasing trend
- <-20% decrease = Decreasing trend
- Otherwise = Stable

#### 3. Budget Overrun Prediction
```swift
func predictBudgetOverruns(transactions: [Transaction], budgets: [Budget]) -> [BudgetPrediction]
```

**Calculation Method:**
1. Calculate days passed and remaining in month
2. Compute daily average spending
3. Project end-of-month total
4. Assess risk level:
   - Low: <90% of budget
   - Medium: 90-99% of budget
   - High: 100-109% of budget
   - Critical: â‰¥110% of budget

**Provides:**
- Current spending
- Projected total
- Days remaining
- Risk level
- Personalized recommendations

#### 4. Intelligent Insight Generation
```swift
func generateInsights(transactions: [Transaction], budgets: [Budget], goals: [Goal]) -> [FinancialInsight]
```

**Insight Types:**

**Spending Insights:**
- Month-over-month comparison (>20% change triggers alert)
- Top spending category identification (>40% of total)
- Unusual transaction detection (>3x average)

**Budget Insights:**
- High-risk budget alerts
- Overrun warnings with projections

**Goal Insights:**
- Near completion notifications (â‰¥90% progress)
- Behind schedule warnings (>20% below expected)

**Savings Insights:**
- Recurring subscription detection
- Potential savings opportunities

## Data Models

### SpendingPattern
```swift
struct SpendingPattern {
    let category: TransactionCategory
    let totalSpent: Double
    let averageTransaction: Double
    let frequency: Int
    let trend: SpendingTrend
    let budgetStatus: BudgetStatus
}
```

### BudgetPrediction
```swift
struct BudgetPrediction {
    let budget: Budget
    let currentSpent: Double
    let projectedTotal: Double
    let daysRemaining: Int
    let riskLevel: RiskLevel
    let recommendation: String
}
```

### FinancialInsight
```swift
struct FinancialInsight: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let type: InsightType        // positive, warning, info
    let category: InsightCategory // spending, budget, goals, savings
    let title: String
    let message: String
    let value: Double
    let priority: InsightPriority // low, medium, high, critical
    let actionable: Bool
    var metadata: [String: String]
}
```

## User Interface

### InsightsScreen
Location: `/Code/Features/Insights/Screen/InsightsScreen.swift`

**Sections:**
1. **Filter Chips** - Category filtering (All/Spending/Budget/Goals/Savings)
2. **Critical Insights** - High priority alerts requiring immediate attention
3. **Budget Predictions** - High-risk budget forecasts
4. **Spending Patterns** - Top 5 categories with trend analysis
5. **All Insights** - Complete list of generated insights

**UI Components:**
- `InsightCard` - Individual insight display with icon, message, and value
- `BudgetPredictionCard` - Detailed prediction with progress bar
- `SpendingPatternCard` - Category summary with trend indicator

### Navigation Integration
- Added to More screen as first item
- Purple chart icon for visual distinction
- Accessible from iPhone and iPad layouts

## Localization

All strings support Portuguese (Brazil) with 48+ localization keys:

**Key Categories:**
- Screen titles and navigation
- Insight categories and types
- Spending trends and patterns
- Budget status and risk levels
- Recommendations and messages
- Time references and formatting

## Usage Example

```swift
// In your ViewModel or View
let analyticsService = FinancialAnalyticsService.shared

// Generate insights
let insights = analyticsService.generateInsights(
    transactions: transactions,
    budgets: budgets,
    goals: goals
)

// Detect patterns
let patterns = analyticsService.detectSpendingPatterns(
    transactions: transactions,
    budgets: budgets
)

// Predict budget overruns
let predictions = analyticsService.predictBudgetOverruns(
    transactions: transactions,
    budgets: budgets
)

// Auto-categorize transactions
let categorized = analyticsService.categorizeTransactions(transactions)
```

## Key Features

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with varied data:**
   - Few transactions (empty state)
   - Many transactions (pattern detection)
   - Different categories
   - Various budget scenarios

2. **Test edge cases:**
   - Month-end scenarios
   - First day of month
   - No budgets set
   - All budgets exceeded

3. **Validate calculations:**
   - Trend detection accuracy
   - Projection accuracy
   - Risk level thresholds

4. **UI/UX testing:**
   - Filter functionality
   - Scroll performance with many insights
   - Localization display
   - iPad layout

## Performance Considerations

- Service uses singleton pattern for efficiency
- Calculations run synchronously (consider async for large datasets)
- Insights are cached in ViewModel
- Refresh on pull-to-refresh or manual trigger
- Consider background calculation for 1000+ transactions

## Integration with Existing Features

**Dashboard:**
- Can add top insights summary card
- Show critical alerts banner

**Budget Screen:**
- Display risk indicators
- Show projection data

**Transactions:**
- Suggest categorization improvements
- Highlight unusual transactions

**Goals:**
- Progress notifications
- Behind-schedule warnings

## Security & Privacy

- All calculations performed locally on device
- No external API calls
- No data leaves the app
- User data remains private
- Complies with LGPD/GDPR requirements
