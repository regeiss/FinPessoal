# ML/AI Financial Insights Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the ML/AI Financial MCP (Model Context Protocol) for machine learning-powered financial predictions and recommendations.

## Architecture

### Core Service: `FinancialAIService`

Location: `/Code/Core/AI/FinancialAIService.swift`

The service provides four main ML-powered capabilities:

## 1. Expense Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

### Algorithm
```swift
func predictExpenses(transactions: [Transaction], months: Int = 3) -> [ExpensePrediction]
```

**ML Techniques:**
- **Linear Regression**: Calculates trend slope using least squares method
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Analyzes monthly patterns for seasonality
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uses coefficient of variation for prediction confidence

**Process:**
1. Group transactions by category
2. Extract last 6 months of historical data
3. Calculate monthly averages
4. Apply linear regression to determine trend
5. Compute seasonal factors (12-month cycle)
6. Project next N months with trend + seasonality
7. Calculate confidence based on data consistency

**Formula:**
```
Predicted Amount = (Base + Trend * Month) * Seasonal Factor
Confidence = 1 - (StdDev / Mean)
```

**Features:**
- Predicts 3 months ahead by default
- Per-category predictions
- Trend detection (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Confidence scores (0-1)
- Historical average comparison

## 2. Anomaly Detection ðŸš¨

### Algorithm
```swift
func detectAnomalies(transactions: [Transaction]) -> [TransactionAnomaly]
```

**ML Techniques:**
- **Z-Score Analysis**: Statistical outlier detection (3-sigma rule)
- **Frequency Analysis**: Temporal pattern detection
- **Similarity Matching**: Duplicate transaction detection

**Detection Methods:**

#### A. Unusual Amount Detection
Uses Z-score to find outliers:
```
Z-Score = |X - Î¼| / Ïƒ
Anomaly if Z-Score > 3 (99.7% confidence)
```

#### B. Frequency Spike Detection
Detects abnormal transaction count:
- Groups by month
- Calculates average frequency
- Flags months with Z-score > 2.5

#### C. Timing Anomalies
Detects suspicious timing:
- Transactions between 23:00 and 05:00
- High-value transactions (>R$ 500)

#### D. Duplicate Detection
Finds potential duplicates:
- Same amount
- Same category
- Within 1 hour

**Severity Levels:**
- **High**: Z-score > 4 or critical patterns
- **Medium**: Z-score 3-4 or potential issues
- **Low**: Minor concerns

## 3. Smart Budget Suggestions ðŸ’¡

### Algorithm
```swift
func generateBudgetSuggestions(
  transactions: [Transaction],
  currentBudgets: [Budget]
) -> [BudgetSuggestion]
```

**ML Techniques:**
- **Percentile Analysis**: Uses 90th percentile for robust estimation
- **Median vs Mean**: Reduces impact of outliers
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates existing budget effectiveness

**Recommendation Logic:**

#### For Existing Budgets:
```
If Usage >= 95%:
  Suggest = P90 * 1.10  // 10% buffer

If Usage <= 60%:
  Suggest = Median * 1.15  // 15% buffer
```

#### For New Budgets:
```
Suggest = P90 * 1.15  // 90th percentile + 15% buffer
```

**Confidence Calculation:**
```
Coverage Confidence = % of data within 2Ïƒ of suggestion
Consistency Confidence = 1 - (Ïƒ / Î¼)
Final Confidence = (Coverage + Consistency) / 2
```

**Impact Levels:**
- **High**: Change > 30%
- **Medium**: Change 15-30%
- **Low**: Change < 15%

## 4. Personalized Advice ðŸŽ¯

### Algorithm
```swift
func generatePersonalizedAdvice(
  transactions: [Transaction],
  budgets: [Budget],
  goals: [Goal],
  predictions: [ExpensePrediction]
) -> [PersonalizedAdvice]
```

**Analysis Categories:**

#### A. Spending Behavior Analysis
- **Concentration Detection**: Warns if one category > 50% of expenses
- **Diversification Suggestions**: Recommends reallocation

#### B. Budget Optimization
- **Underutilization**: Flags budgets with <50% usage
- **Reallocation Opportunities**: Suggests moving funds

#### C. Goal Strategies
- **Feasibility Check**: Validates if monthly requirement is realistic
- **Timeline Adjustment**: Suggests if required savings > 30% of income

#### D. Savings Opportunities
- **Subscription Analysis**: Aggregates recurring payments
- **Optimization Threshold**: Flags if total > R$ 200/month
- **Potential Savings**: Estimates 30% reduction possibility

#### E. Income Pattern Analysis
- **Volatility Detection**: Calculates coefficient of variation
- **Stability Warning**: Triggers if CV > 30%
- **Emergency Fund Advice**: Recommends buffer creation

#### F. Financial Risk Assessment
- **Expense/Income Ratio**: Monitors spending vs earnings
- **High Risk**: Ratio > 90%
- **Critical Risk**: Immediate action recommended

**Priority Levels:**
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (ratio > 90%)
- **High**: Important issues (volatility, unmet goals)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunities
- **Low**: General suggestions

## Data Models

### ExpensePrediction
```swift
struct ExpensePrediction {
  let category: TransactionCategory
  let predictions: [MonthlyPrediction]
  let historicalAverage: Double
  let trendSlope: Double
  let dataPoints: Int
}
```

### TransactionAnomaly

## User Interface

### AIInsightsScreen
Location: `/Code/Features/Insights/Screen/AIInsightsScreen.swift`

**Sections:**
1. **Personalized Advice** - Top 5 recommendations with priority
2. **Anomalies** - Critical suspicious transactions
3. **Expense Predictions** - 3-month forecasts per category
4. **Budget Suggestions** - Optimized budget recommendations

**UI Components:**
- `PersonalizedAdviceCard` - Shows advice with potential savings
- `AnomalyCard` - Displays suspicious transactions
- `ExpensePredictionCard` - Shows predictions with confidence
- `BudgetSuggestionCard` - Presents suggestions with impact level

## Statistical Foundations

### Linear Regression
Used for trend analysis:
```
Slope (Î²) = (nâˆ‘xy - âˆ‘xâˆ‘y) / (nâˆ‘xÂ² - (âˆ‘x)Â²)
```

### Z-Score
Used for anomaly detection:
```
Z = (X - Î¼) / Ïƒ
Where: Î¼ = mean, Ïƒ = standard deviation
```

### Coefficient of Variation
Used for confidence and stability:
```
CV = Ïƒ / Î¼
Confidence = 1 - CV
```

### Percentile Calculation
Used for budget suggestions:
```
P90 = Value at index âŒŠ0.9 * (n-1)âŒ‹ in sorted array
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with varied data:**
   - Small datasets (< 10 transactions)
   - Large datasets (> 1000 transactions)
   - Different time ranges
   - Various categories

2. **Test edge cases:**
   - No historical data
   - Highly volatile spending
   - Perfect budget adherence
   - Extreme outliers

3. **Validate ML accuracy:**
   - Compare predictions with actual outcomes
   - Check anomaly false positive rate
   - Verify budget suggestion reasonability
   - Assess advice relevance

4. **Performance testing:**
